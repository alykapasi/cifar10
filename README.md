# CIFAR10 Example

This project demonstrates training simple models on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The dataset is loaded directly using `torchvision.datasets.CIFAR10`, so no custom dataset code or manual data extraction is required.

Run the notebook in `notebooks/experiments.ipynb` to see an example of loading the dataset and preparing dataloaders.
